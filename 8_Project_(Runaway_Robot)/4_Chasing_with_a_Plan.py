# ----------
# Part Four
#
# Again, you'll track down and recover the runaway Traxbot.
# But this time, your speed will be about the same as the runaway bot.
# This may require more careful planning than you used last time.
#
# ----------
# YOUR JOB
#
# Complete the next_move function, similar to how you did last time.
#
# ----------
# GRADING
#
# Same as part 3. Again, try to catch the target in as few steps as possible.
